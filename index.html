        My name is Ibrahim from Walewale in the nort-east region of Ghana. I am
        currently pursuing Bsc in Information Technology in University of Ghana
        Legon campus. I'm in level 200 now. I always wanted to be a great
        software engineer, I like many inventors . They have influenced millions
        of people through their inventions. I also wanted to be a great
        Inventor, like Elon Musk, Bill gates and the like. Of course, I am
        nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just a college student. But my
        dream is still alive. You can check out a table showing my
